# pyapiary

A clean, modular set of Python connectors and utilities for working with both **APIs** and **DBMS backends**, unified by a centralized `Broker` abstraction and a consistent interface. Designed for easy testing, code reuse, and plug-and-play extensibility.

## ⚠️ **Deprecation notice**

`pyapiary` is the successor to the `ppp-connectors` package.
The original `ppp-connectors` package has been frozen at its final 1.1.13 release
and will continue to remain available on PyPI for existing users.
New development and releases are published under the `pyapiary` package name.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install ppp-connectors
```

Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` for local development:

```bash
cp dev_env/.env.example dev_env/.env
```

Environment variables are loaded automatically via the `combine_env_configs()` helper.

---

## 🔌 API Connectors

All API connectors inherit from a common `Broker` abstraction that comes in two flavors:

- `Broker` for synchronous usage
- `AsyncBroker` for asynchronous usage

Each API connector has both a sync and async version (e.g., `URLScanConnector` and `AsyncURLScanConnector`) with **identical method names** and consistent behavior. Additionally, both support context-management with `with` and `async with`.

### 🧰 Shared Features

- Accept API credentials via env vars or constructor args (`load_env_vars=True`)
- Unified interface: `.get()`, `.post()`, etc.
- Custom headers, query params, and body data via `**kwargs`
- Logging, retry/backoff support
- Proxy and SSL configuration
- Optional VCR integration for tests

> Choose the version based on your environment:
> - Use `URLScanConnector` in CLI scripts and sync jobs
> - Use `AsyncURLScanConnector` in FastAPI or async pipelines

---

### 🌐 Sync Example (URLScan)
``` python
from pyapiary.api_connectors.urlscan import URLScanConnector

scanner = URLScanConnector(load_env_vars=True)
result = scanner.scan(url="https://example.com")
print(result.json())
```
---

### ⚡ Async Example (URLScan)
``` python
import asyncio
from pyapiary.api_connectors.urlscan import AsyncURLScanConnector

async def main():
   scanner = AsyncURLScanConnector(load_env_vars=True)
   response = await scanner.scan(url="https://example.com")
   print(await response.json())

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Customizing API Requests with **kwargs

All connector methods accept arbitrary keyword arguments using `**kwargs`. These arguments are passed directly to the underlying `httpx` request methods, enabling support for any feature available in [`httpx`](https://www.python-httpx.org/api/#request) — including custom headers, query parameters, timeouts, authentication, and more. Additionally, for APIs that accept arbitrary fields in their request body (like `URLScan`), these can also be passed as part of `**kwargs` and will be merged into the outgoing request. This enables full control over how API requests are constructed without needing to modify connector internals.

#### Example (URLScan with custom headers and params)

```python
result = scanner.scan(
    url="https://example.com",
    visibility="unlisted",
    headers={"X-Custom-Header": "my-value"},
    params={"pretty": "true"}
)
```

This pattern allows flexibility without needing to subclass or modify the connector.

### Proxy Awareness

API connectors inherit from the `Broker` class and support flexible proxy configuration for outgoing HTTP requests. You can set proxies in multiple ways:
- a single `proxy` parameter (applies to all requests),
- a per-scheme `mounts` parameter (e.g., separate proxies for `http` and `https` as a dictionary),
- or environment variables (from `.env` or OS environment, specifically `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`).
> 🧠 **Note for async connectors:** Per-scheme `mounts` are not supported by `httpx.AsyncClient`. If you pass `mounts` to an async connector, it will raise a `ValueError`. Use the `proxy` argument or rely on environment variables (`load_env_vars=True`) instead.

**Proxy precedence:**
`mounts` > `proxy` > environment source (`.env` via `load_env_vars=True`, else OS environment if `trust_env=True`) > none.

- If you provide explicit `mounts`, these override all other proxy settings.
- If you set `proxy`, it overrides environment proxies but is overridden by `mounts`.
- If neither is set, and `load_env_vars=True`, proxy settings are loaded from `.env` via `combine_env_configs()`.
    - If both `.env` and OS environment have the same variable, OS environment takes precedence.
- If no explicit proxy or mounts are set but `trust_env=True`, HTTPX will use OS environment proxy settings (including `NO_PROXY`).

**Examples:**

*Using a single proxy:*
```python
from pyapiary.api_connectors.urlscan import URLScanConnector
conn = URLScanConnector(proxy="http://myproxy:8080")
```

*Using per-scheme mounts:*
```python
conn = URLScanConnector(mounts={"https://": "http://myproxy:8080", "http://": "http://myproxy2:8888"})
```

*Loading proxy from `.env`:*
```python
# .env file contains: HTTP_PROXY="http://myproxy:8080"
conn = URLScanConnector(load_env_vars=True)
# Uses HTTP_PROXY from .env even if not in OS environment.
```

**Note:** Any changes to proxy settings require re-instantiating the connector for changes to take effect.

### SSL Verification and Per-Request Options

You can now pass any `httpx.Client` keyword arguments (such as `verify=False`, `http2=True`) when instantiating a connector. These options will be applied to all requests made by that connector.

Additionally, per-request keyword arguments can be passed to methods like `.get()`, `.post()`, etc., and will be forwarded to `httpx.Client.request` for that single call.

Setting `verify=False` disables SSL verification and can be useful for testing against servers with self-signed certificates, but **should not be used in production** unless you understand the security implications.

**Examples:**

*Disable SSL verification at the connector level:*
```python
conn = URLScanConnector(verify=False)
response = conn.get("https://self-signed.badssl.com/")
print(response.status_code)
```

*Disable SSL verification for a single request:*
```python
conn = URLScanConnector()
response = conn.get("https://self-signed.badssl.com/", verify=False)
print(response.status_code)
```

*Enable HTTP/2:*
```python
conn = URLScanConnector(http2=True)
response = conn.get("https://nghttp2.org/httpbin/get")
print(response.http_version)
```

### 🧬 GraphQL & OpenCTI

`GraphQLConnector` is a generic, schema-agnostic GraphQL executor built on the same `Broker` (so it inherits retries, proxies, timeouts, logging). Like the DBMS connectors, it does not care what your query is — it just runs it. It returns the raw `httpx.Response` (house convention) and raises `GraphQLError` when a `200` response carries a top-level `errors` array (GraphQL reports query errors with HTTP 200, so `raise_for_status` never catches them).

```python
from pyapiary.api_connectors.graphql import GraphQLConnector

gql = GraphQLConnector(base_url="https://api.example.com", endpoint="/graphql")
resp = gql.execute("query($n: Int) { things(first: $n) { id } }", {"n": 5})
data = resp.json()["data"]
# Pass raise_on_errors=False to inspect resp.json()["errors"] yourself.
```

`OpenCTIConnector` is a thick, curated connector (urlscan-style) layered on `GraphQLConnector`, with query field selections pinned to OpenCTI **6.9.x** (verified against `docs/opencti-6.9.6.graphql`). It reads `OPENCTI_URL` and `OPENCTI_TOKEN` from the environment (or accepts them explicitly). Access is governed entirely by the permissions on the token's user — so scope the token appropriately, including for mutations run via `execute`.

```python
from pyapiary.api_connectors.opencti import OpenCTIConnector

with OpenCTIConnector() as octi:                       # env: OPENCTI_URL / OPENCTI_TOKEN
    # filter helper builds the 6.9.x FilterGroup for you
    flt = octi.filter_group("name", "Cobalt Strike")

    # generic entity search (any type) — `representative.main` is a universal label
    resp = octi.search_entities(types=["Malware"], filters=flt, first=50)
    conn = resp.json()["data"]["stixCoreObjects"]

    # dedicated methods for type-specific fields
    octi.get_indicators(search="1.2.3.4")
    octi.get_observables(types=["IPv4-Addr"])
    octi.get_relationships(from_id="<id>", relationship_type="uses")

    # anything outside the catalog: drop to the generic executor
    octi.execute("query { me { name } }")
```

> **Existence check** — there is no `exists()` method (no connector returns a synthesized value). Use `search_entities(..., first=1)` and check whether the result's `edges` is empty.
>
> **Pagination** — connectors don't auto-paginate (same as `URLScanConnector`). Pass `after` with the previous page's `pageInfo.endCursor` and loop yourself; `pageInfo.globalCount` gives the total.
>
> **Async** — `AsyncGraphQLConnector` / `AsyncOpenCTIConnector` mirror the sync API.

The query catalog (`opencti_queries.py`) is validated offline against the committed SDL in CI. To refresh the schema for a new OpenCTI version, run a GraphQL introspection query against the instance (requires the server's `APP__GRAPHQL__PLAYGROUND__FORCE_DISABLED_INTROSPECTION=false`), save the result as `docs/opencti_schema.json`, and convert it to SDL with `graphql-core`'s `build_client_schema` + `print_schema`. Then use `dev_env/opencti/gen_opencti_fields.py <Type>` to author field selections from the SDL.

## 🗃️ DBMS Connectors

Each database connector follows a class-based pattern and supports reusable sessions, query helpers, and in some cases bulk helpers (e.g., `insert_many`, `bulk_insert`, etc.).

### MongoDB

Note: `query(...)` is deprecated in favor of `find(filter=..., projection=..., batch_size=...)`. The `query` method remains as a compatibility alias and logs a deprecation warning.

Sync connector
```python
from pyapiary.dbms_connectors.mongo import MongoConnector

# Recommended: use as a context manager (auto-closes)
with MongoConnector(
    "mongodb://localhost:27017",
    username="root",
    password="example",
    auth_retry_attempts=3,
    auth_retry_wait=1.0,
) as conn:
    # Clean up prior test docs
    conn.delete_many("mydb", "mycol", {"_sample": True})

    # Insert and upsert
    conn.insert_many("mydb", "mycol", [{"_id": 1, "foo": "bar", "_sample": True}])
    conn.upsert_many(
        "mydb",
        "mycol",
        [{"_id": 1, "foo": "baz", "_sample": True}, {"_id": 2, "foo": "qux", "_sample": True}],
        unique_key="_id",
    )

    # Find with projection and paging
    for doc in conn.find("mydb", "mycol", filter={"_sample": True}, projection={"_id": 1, "foo": 1}, batch_size=100):
        print(doc)

    # Distinct values
    vals = conn.distinct("mydb", "mycol", key="foo", filter={"_sample": True})
    print(vals)

# Manual lifecycle control is also supported
conn = MongoConnector("mongodb://localhost:27017")
try:
    list(conn.find("mydb", "mycol", filter={}))
finally:
    conn.close()
```

Async connector
```python
import asyncio
from pyapiary.dbms_connectors.mongo_async import AsyncMongoConnector

async def main():
    async with AsyncMongoConnector(
        "mongodb://localhost:27017",
        username="root",
        password="example",
        auth_retry_attempts=3,
        auth_retry_wait=1.0,
    ) as conn:
        await conn.delete_many("mydb", "mycol", {"_sample": True})
        await conn.insert_many("mydb", "mycol", [{"_id": 1, "foo": "bar", "_sample": True}])
        await conn.upsert_many(
            "mydb", "mycol",
            [{"_id": 1, "foo": "baz", "_sample": True}],
            unique_key="_id",
        )
        async for doc in conn.find("mydb", "mycol", filter={"_sample": True}, projection={"_id": 1, "foo": 1}):
            print(doc)
        vals = await conn.distinct("mydb", "mycol", key="foo", filter={"_sample": True})
        print(vals)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Elasticsearch

```python
# The query method returns a generator; use list() or iterate to access results
from pyapiary.dbms_connectors.elasticsearch import ElasticsearchConnector

conn = ElasticsearchConnector(["http://localhost:9200"])
results = list(conn.query("my-index", {"query": {"match_all": {}}}))
for doc in results:
    print(doc)
```

`query` accepts three forms:

```python
conn.query("my-index", "status:500 AND host:web*")        # Lucene query string
conn.query("my-index", {"query": {"match_all": {}}})      # full DSL search body
conn.query("my-index", {"match": {"host": "web1"}})       # bare DSL query clause
```

Set `size` for the per-batch page size and `scroll` for how long each scroll context
stays alive between batches; raise `scroll` if processing a batch is slow. A `size`
specified inside the DSL body takes precedence over the `size` argument.

Authenticate with `username`/`password` or with `api_key`; omit both for an
unsecured cluster. `verify_certs`, `ca_certs` and `request_timeout` are also
available, and any other keyword argument is passed through to `Elasticsearch`.

### ODBC (e.g., Postgres, Teradata)

For automatic connection handling, use `ODBCConnector` as a context manager

```python
from pyapiary.dbms_connectors.odbc import ODBCConnector

with ODBCConnector("DSN=PostgresLocal;UID=postgres;PWD=postgres") as db:
   rows = conn.query("SELECT * FROM my_table")
   print(list(rows))
```

If you'd like to keep manual control, you can still use the `.close()` method

```python
from pyapiary.dbms_connectors.odbc import ODBCConnector

conn = ODBCConnector("DSN=PostgresLocal;UID=postgres;PWD=postgres")
rows = conn.query("SELECT * FROM my_table")
print(list(rows))
conn.close()
```

### Splunk

```python
from pyapiary.dbms_connectors.splunk import SplunkConnector

conn = SplunkConnector("localhost", 8089, "admin", "admin123", scheme="https", verify=False)
results = conn.query("search index=_internal | head 5")
```

## 🧪 Testing

### ✅ Unit tests

- Located in `tests/<connector_name>/test_unit_<connector>.py`
- Use mocking (`MagicMock`, `patch`) to avoid hitting external APIs
- Async connectors use `pytest-asyncio` and require tests to be decorated with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`

### 🔁 Integration tests

- Use [VCR.py](https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy) to record HTTP interactions
- Cassettes stored in: `tests/<connector_name>/cassettes/`
- Automatically redact secrets (API keys, tokens, etc.)
- Marked with `@pytest.mark.integration`

```bash
pytest -m integration
```


### Manual Testing
- Located in dev_env
- Do not use pytest or mocking
- run the docker-compose.yaml to stand up services, change directories into the folder in dev_env you wish to test
- execute the following to test your module
```
poetry run python <your test file here>.py
```

### 🧼 Suppress warnings

Add this to `pytest.ini`:

```ini
[pytest]
markers =
    integration: marks integration tests
```

## 🧑‍💻 Contributing / Adding a Connector

To add a new connector:

1. **Module**: Place your module in:
   - `src/pyapiary/api_connectors/` for API-based integrations
   - `src/pyapiary/dbms_connectors/` for database-style connectors

2. **Base class**:
   - Use the `Broker` class for APIs
   - Use the appropriate DBMS connector template for DBMSs

3. **Auth**: Pull secrets using `combine_env_configs()` to support `.env`, environment variables, and CI/CD injection.

4. **Testing**:
   - Add unit tests in: `tests/<name>/test_unit_<connector>.py`
   - Add integration tests in: `tests/<name>/test_integration_<connector>.py`
   - Save cassettes in: `tests/<name>/cassettes/`

5. **Docs**:
   - Add an example usage to this `README.md`
   - Document all methods with docstrings
   - Ensure your connector supports logging if `enable_logging=True` is passed

6. **Export**:
   - Optionally expose your connector via `__init__.py` for easier importing

## 🛠️ Dev Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robd518/pyapiary.git
cd pyapiary

cp .env.example .env

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

poetry install  # if using poetry, or `pip install -e .[dev]`

pytest           # run all tests
black .          # format code
flake8 .         # linting
```

## 🔐 Secrets and Redaction

Sensitive values like API keys are redacted using the `AUTH_PARAM_REDACT` list in `conftest.py`. This ensures `.yaml` cassettes don’t leak credentials.

Redacted fields include:
- Query/body fields like `api_key`, `key`, `token`
- Header fields like `Authorization`, `X-API-Key`
- URI query parameters

---

## ✅ Summary

- Centralized request broker for all APIs
- Full support for both sync and async API connectors with consistent method signatures
- Robust DBMS connectors
- Easy-to-write unit and integration tests with automatic redaction
- Environment-agnostic configuration system
- VCR-powered CI-friendly test suite
